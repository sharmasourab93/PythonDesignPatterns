# Design patterns

Each design systematically names, explains and evaluates an important and recurring design in object oriented systems.

Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architecture.
### What are design patterns? 
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution to that problem in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. 

In general, a pattern has four essential elements
* Pattern Name <br/>
    *Naming a pattern increases design vocabulary*<br/>
    
* Problem <br/>
    *When to apply a pattern explains the problem and the context*<br/>
    
* Solution <br/>
    *Elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities and or collborations*<br/>
* Consequence <br/>
    *Consequences are results and trade-offs of applying the pattern*<br/>
    
A design pattern names, abstracts and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creatinga
